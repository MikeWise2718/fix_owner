# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python script that recursively takes ownership of directories and files when the current owner is an invalid or orphaned SID (Security Identifier). This is particularly useful after system migrations, user deletions, or when inherited permissions cause access issues. The script will provide various options for execution control, statistics tracking, and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to take ownership of directories with orphaned SIDs, so that I can restore access to directories after user deletions or system migrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed with a root path THEN the system SHALL recursively examine directory ownership starting from that path
2. WHEN a directory has an invalid or orphaned SID as owner THEN the system SHALL change ownership to a specified valid account
3. WHEN a directory already has valid ownership THEN the system SHALL skip changing ownership for that directory
4. IF the script is run without execute option (-x) THEN the system SHALL perform a dry run without making any changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control file ownership examination, so that I can choose whether to process files in addition to directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the -f option is specified THEN the system SHALL examine and change file ownership in addition to directories
2. WHEN the -f option is not specified THEN the system SHALL only process directories
3. WHEN a file has an invalid or orphaned SID as owner THEN the system SHALL change ownership to the specified valid account

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control recursion behavior, so that I can limit processing to specific directory levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the -r option is specified THEN the system SHALL recurse into subdirectories
2. WHEN the -r option is not specified THEN the system SHALL only process the root directory level
3. WHEN recursing THEN the system SHALL apply the same ownership rules to all subdirectories and files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling, so that the script continues processing even when individual operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an exception occurs during ownership change THEN the system SHALL catch the exception and continue processing
2. WHEN an exception is caught THEN the system SHALL print error information to the console
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL report the total number of exceptions encountered

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed statistics, so that I can understand what changes were made during execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display the number of directories traversed
2. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display the number of files traversed
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display the number of directory ownerships changed
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display the number of file ownerships changed
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display the number of exceptions caught
6. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display the total execution time in seconds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want output control options, so that I can adjust the verbosity of the script execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the -v option is specified THEN the system SHALL output the name of each path being examined
2. WHEN the -q option is specified THEN the system SHALL output nothing, including final statistics
3. WHEN neither -v nor -q is specified THEN the system SHALL provide standard output with final statistics only

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want execution time limits, so that I can prevent the script from running indefinitely on large directory structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the -ts option is specified with a number THEN the system SHALL terminate execution after that many seconds
2. WHEN the time limit is reached THEN the system SHALL stop processing and display current statistics
3. WHEN no time limit is specified THEN the system SHALL run until completion

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper command-line interface, so that I can easily configure and execute the script.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed THEN the system SHALL require a root path as the first positional argument
2. WHEN the --help option is used THEN the system SHALL display usage information and available options
3. WHEN invalid arguments are provided THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the script is run without Administrator privileges THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate warning or error

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the script to use appropriate Python modules, so that it can properly interact with Windows security features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL import pywin32 module for Windows security operations
2. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL import os module for file system operations
3. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL import argparse module for command-line argument parsing
4. IF required modules are not available THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
