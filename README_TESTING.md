## Prerequisites

### Installing pytest (Optional but Recommended)
For enhanced testing capabilities and better reporting, install pytest:

```cmd
# Install pytest and coverage tools
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Or install all development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Then uncomment the dev dependencies in requirements.txt and run:
# pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8 mypy
```

### Alternative: Using Built-in unittest
The tests are designed to work with Python's built-in unittest module, so pytest is optional but provides better output formatting and additional features.

## Running the Tests

### Run All Tests (Recommended)
```bash
# Using the comprehensive test runner (works without pytest)
python tests/test_all_core_functionality.py

# Or using pytest (if installed)
pytest tests/ -v
```
This runs all unit tests and integration tests in a comprehensive suite.

### Run Integration Tests Only
```bash
python test_integration.py
```
This runs only the integration and end-to-end tests.

### Run Individual Unit Tests
```bash
python test_security_manager.py
python test_filesystem_walker.py
python test_error_manager.py
# ... etc
```

## Test Results and Reporting

### Comprehensive Test Results
The test suite provides detailed reporting including:
- Total tests run across all categories
- Pass/fail counts for each test category
- Execution time for performance monitoring
- Detailed failure information when issues occur

### Integration Test Specific Results
Integration tests provide additional reporting:
- Test directory structure creation and cleanup status
- Performance metrics for large structure testing
- Timeout behavior validation
- Error handling verification

## Test Coverage

1. **Requirement 1** - Directory ownership with orphaned SIDs
2. **Requirement 2** - File ownership examination control (-f option)
3. **Requirement 3** - Recursion behavior control (-r option)
4. **Requirement 4** - Comprehensive error handling
5. **Requirement 5** - Detailed statistics reporting
6. **Requirement 6** - Output control options (-v, -q)
7. **Requirement 7** - Execution time limits (-to option)
8. **Requirement 8** - Command-line interface validation
9. **Requirement 9** - Python module dependencies

### Pytest Code Coverage

When using pytest with coverage reporting, you can generate detailed coverage reports:

```cmd
# Run tests with coverage reporting
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Generate detailed HTML coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run tests with coverage and generate XML report (for CI/CD)
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term
```

#### Coverage Report Output
After running pytest with coverage, you'll see:

1. **Terminal Output**: Shows coverage percentage and missing lines

3. **XML Report**: Machine-readable report in `coverage.xml` for CI/CD integration

### Command-Line Option Testing
All command-line options are tested in various combinations:
- `-x` (execute mode) vs dry-run mode
- `-r` (recurse) vs single-level processing
- `-f` (files) vs directories-only processing
- `-v` (verbose) vs normal vs `-q` (quiet) output
- `-to` (timeout) with various timeout values
- Owner account specifications

### Error Scenario Testing
Comprehensive error scenarios are tested:
- Permission denied errors
- File not found errors
- Invalid SID scenarios
- Network path issues
- Timeout conditions
- Invalid command-line arguments

## Performance Benchmarks

### Performance Test Targets
The integration tests validate performance against these targets:
- **Large structures**: Complete processing within 10 seconds (50 dirs, 100 files)
- **Deep structures**: Complete processing within 5 seconds (10 levels deep)
- **Timeout handling**: Proper termination within timeout limits
- **Memory usage**: No obvious memory leaks during large operations

### Scalability Testing
Tests verify the script can handle:
- Directory structures with hundreds of items
- Deep nesting (10+ levels)
- Mixed file and directory processing
- Long-running operations with timeout controls

## Mock Strategy

### Windows API Mocking
Integration tests use comprehensive mocking for Windows APIs:
- `win32security` module functions
- `ctypes.windll.shell32` for privilege checking
- File system operations for cross-platform testing
- Error injection for testing error handling paths

### Component Integration
Tests verify proper integration between components:
- SecurityManager ↔ FileSystemWalker integration
- ErrorManager ↔ all components integration
- OutputManager ↔ all components integration
- TimeoutManager ↔ FileSystemWalker integration
- StatsTracker ↔ all components integration

## Continuous Integration Considerations

### Test Reliability
- All tests use mocked dependencies for reliable execution
- No external dependencies on actual Windows security APIs
- Temporary directory cleanup ensures no test pollution
- Cross-platform compatibility through mocking

### Test Speed
- Integration tests complete in under 1 second typically
- Performance tests use reduced data sets for CI environments
- Timeout tests use short timeouts for quick validation
- Mock responses are optimized for speed

### Test Isolation
- Each test class uses independent temporary directories
- Mock objects are reset between tests
- No shared state between test methods
- Proper cleanup in tearDown methods

## Troubleshooting Test Issues

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all test files are in the same directory as the main script files
2. **Permission Errors**: Tests should run without Administrator privileges due to mocking
3. **Timeout Issues**: Performance tests may need adjustment on slower systems
4. **Path Issues**: Tests create temporary directories that should clean up automatically

### Debug Mode
For debugging test issues, you can:
1. Run individual test files to isolate problems
2. Add print statements in test methods for debugging
3. Check temporary directory cleanup if disk space issues occur
4. Verify mock setup if integration tests fail unexpectedly

## Future Test Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Real Windows API integration tests (when running on Windows with appropriate privileges)
- Network path testing scenarios
- Unicode filename handling tests
- Very large directory structure stress tests
- Multi-threading safety tests (if implemented)

### Test Automation
- GitHub Actions integration for automated testing
- Test coverage reporting
- Performance regression detection
- Automated test result reporting

## Conclusion

The comprehensive testing suite ensures the fix-owner script is robust, reliable, and performs well across various scenarios. The integration tests specifically validate that all components work together correctly and that the complete workflow functions as specified in the requirements.

Run `python test_all_core_functionality.py` to execute the complete test suite and verify all functionality is working correctly.
